# FinalYearProject


The App name has been changed from Jobmirron to CrewManager in the late development stages due to this in some of the files and system files still named as Jobmirron.  

NOTE: All my code can be found in the following folders:
        
            App/CrewManager/ViewController 
            App/CrewManager/UtilitiesFolder


All other folders within the project contains System files and Third Party liberaries 
                
                LibrariesFolder: Contains all the third-party libraries.

                The rest of folders contains system files or third library files.
