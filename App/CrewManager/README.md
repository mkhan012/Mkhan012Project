# FinalYearProject

The App name has been changed from Jobmirron to CrewManager, however in some of the files its still named as Jobmirron.  

NOTE: All my code can be found in the following folder:
        
            App/CrewManager/ViewController 
            App/CrewManager/UtilitiesFolder


All other folders within the project contains System files and Third Party liberaries 
                
                LibrariesFolder: Contains all the third-party libraries.

                The rest of folders contains system files or third library files.
